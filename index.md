## About Me

Hi! I am a Ph.D. student at Universit√© de Caen in Normandy, France, under the supervision of Jalal Fadili. My work focuses on studying theoretical stochastic dynamics for optimization problems. I am particularly interested in the possible applications to Machine Learning, related to variance reduction methods and continuous optimization.
